## TL;DR  
I am an ex-Cosmologist turned Data Scientist with over 10 years experience in Machine/Deep Learning, statistical inference, and with some experience Optimisation by means of Reinforcement Learning. I am result driven and highly detail oriented, motivated by intellectual challenges and love analysing data to communicate insights for better decisions within organisations. 

[comment]: <>  I am looking for a London-based permanent technical role as an individual contributor in a data-driven company with exciting and challenging questions.


## In Detail   
Trained as a physicist, in my previous astronomy reincarnation I analysed maps of galaxies to measure aspects of Cosmology, e.g, the expansion rate of the Universe and the abundance of Dark Matter. 

In 2014 I transitioned to data science, where I first worked for 3.5 years in a small marketing consulting firm working mostly on customer/user segmentation. 

In 2018 I was employed as the first Data Scientist in a biotech company where I worked mostly on protein design for therapeutics by creating Machine/Deep Learning predictive models from the data produced in the lab.  

In 2020 I joined Babylon Health as a Senior Data Scientist.  

## Aw Shucks, More?  

### Cosmology (2006-2014)
**XKCD-ish pitch**: I measured a bump on a graph which excited a small number of specialists.  
**Professional 10 second elevator pitch**: As an obsservational cosmologist, I analysed 3D maps of galaxies to quantify the amount of dark matter in the Universe as well as measure its expansion rate.     
**Elevator pitch to the 100th floor**: To this end I measured the large-scale structure of ensembles of distant galaxies generated due to gravity. This encompasses a weak signal (1% effect!) which is actually the longest [*standard ruler*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ruler){:target="_blank"} known is cosmology at a length of half a billion light years!     
**Claim for fame**: In my [second publication](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...719.1032K/abstract){:target="_blank"} I pissed off a tenured professor by debunking [his claims](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.399.1663G/abstract){:target="_blank"}. 
**Claim for fame II**: I met eight nobel prize winners in physics, six of which attended my lectures.

This is the kind of plot I stared at for years. The bump at the tick mark at value 100 is a beautiful beast. It represents our understanding of early Unvierse physics and its propagation to the recent Universe an its manifestation on the large-scale structure of galaxies. This bump, called by specialist the *Baryonic Acoustic Oscilattions* (though I prefered calling it the *Baryonic Acoutstic Feature*) is the largest standard ruler known at half a billion of light-years. They are real and they are [magnificant :-)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQNkeugaAMc){:target="_blank"}.


Fascinated by the concept of gravity I started my career in data analysis when I did research in cosmology. Like most things in my life I got into astronomy by random chance. In the summer of 2006 Professor [David Hogg](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/){:target="_blank"} from NYU offered free laptops and a Cosmology Summer School in Santa Fe conditioned that we work on a project. He linked me with [Andreas Berlind](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aberlind/){:target="_blank"}, who was a postdoc at the time. He was my first anlaysis and astronomy guru and I had minor contributions to his research on clustering of dark matter based on simulations. I presented my results to the department, and Professor [Michael Blanton](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/michael-blanton.html){:target="_blank"} offered me a subsequent project which led me to choose him as my Ph.D advisor. 

Most of my research in my Ph.D (New York University 2006-2011) and subsequent postdoc (Swinburne University of Technology 2011-2014) was about relating astronomical observations to the standard theory of the BigBang, which cosmologists call the standard LCDM. That means a Unvierse that is dominated gravitaionially by Cold Dark Matter (CDM) but is expanding in an accelerating mode due to another unkown material (perhaps too) conveniently called Dark Matter (where we use Lambda as a symbol to quantify it).  

In practice this meant analysing 3D maps of galaxies surveyed by two groups of astronomers that I was part of, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the WiggleZ. The observable of interest is the said bump, the Baryonic Acoustic Feature. My closest collaborator was [Ariel Sanchez](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~arielsan/){:target="_blank"}, who I cross continents for great conversations.



My publications of this eight year journey can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yNVHEacAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} or by first author on the [astrophysics data system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=database%3A%20astronomy&q=author%3A(%22%5Ekazin%2C%20eyal%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0){:target="_blank"}. For some reason NYU still has my site where I share the [Luminous Red Galaxy data](https://cosmo.nyu.edu/~eak306/BAF.html){:target="_blank"}. 

### Transitioning To Data Science (2014)  
**XKCD-ish pitch**: I worked on a garbage-in garbage-out project for [a non-startup](https://web.archive.org/web/20170912075710/http://connectomex.com/){:target="_blank"}.      
**Claim for fame**: I was known as "that guy with the blog post with the notebook". Strategically advertised in LinkedIn and Facebook forums, [the post](https://betterbayes.wordpress.com/2014/07/24/preperation-for-a-transition-to-data-science/){:target="_blank"} had over 1,000 reads in the first day (which was a lot at the time!)

### SCL Group / Cambridge Analytica (2014-2018)
**What most people want to know**: I requested not to work on the Republican 2016 presidential campain.   
**Claim for fame**: Half of a joke that I made about [Alexander Nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nix){:target="_blank"} at a company party was [printed in the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/cambridge-analytica.html){:target="_blank"}.

But for the intended auidence that was not the punch line. The punch line was (which needs context to appreciate): 
> How does he do it? He sells them Ripon!  

The context: Ripon was a customized campaign software platform that Cambridge Analytic sold. I always thought it a peculiar name (considering it sounds so much like Rip Off) until I learned that is is named after the town of [Ripon, Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripon){:target="_blank"}, where the Republican Party was founded).

### LabGenius (2018-2020)
**XKCD-ish pitch**: I made nice AI-ish visuals to impress investors.  
**Claim for fame**: I made a presentation with cool animation of dancing Amino Acid letters that was seen by representatives of all big pharmaceuticals worldwide.   

### Babylon Health (2020-)
I joined Babylon Health in mid April of 2020.
