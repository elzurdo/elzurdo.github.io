## TL;DR  
I am an ex-Cosmologist turned Data Scientist with over 10 years experience in Machine/Deep Learning, 
statistical inference, and with some experience Optimisation. 

I am result driven and highly detail oriented, 
motivated by intellectual challenges and love analysing data to communicate insights for better decisions within organisations. 

I have been told that my main strength is facilitating stakeholders to make data driven decisions. 
I do this through critical understanding of the essence of a problem and my joy for 
creating visuals that communicate actionable insights. 
Other strong suits of mine are learning new topics, attention to detail, obtaining and 
communicating results as well as finding creative ways to prototype pragmatic solutions for complex problems.


As of August 2024 I've started creating articles for Towards Data Science on
[my Medium page](https://eyal-kazin.medium.com/):

* 🧠🧹  [Causality — Mental Hygiene for Data Science](https://bit.ly/causal-mental-hygiene)


* ➡️ [Start Asking Your Data “Why?” — A Gentle Intro To Causality
](https://bit.ly/start-ask-why-medium)

* 🪜 [Mastering Simpson’s Paradox — My Gateway to Causality](https://bit.ly/simpsons-paradox-tds)

[comment]: <>  I am looking for a London-based permanent technical role as an individual contributor in a data-driven company with exciting and challenging questions.


## In Detail   
Trained as a physicist, in my previous astronomy reincarnation I analysed maps of galaxies to measure aspects of Cosmology, e.g, the expansion rate of the Universe and the abundance of Dark Matter. 

In 2014 I transitioned to data science, where I first worked for 3.5 years in a small marketing consulting firm working mostly on customer/user segmentation. 

In 2018 I was employed as the first Data Scientist in a biotech company where I worked mostly on protein design for therapeutics by creating Machine/Deep Learning predictive models from the data produced in the lab.  

In 2020 I joined Babylon as a Senior Data Scientist and was promoted to Staff.  
I developed end-to-end R&D projects and conducted technical support 
to improve the Symptom Checker product. 
In practice I assisted transfer of medical knowledge to the product, 
prototyped solutions and collaborated with engineers to put into production and consult 
with product managers and clinicians to ensure projects were delivered on time and quantified 
impact reported to the larger Tribe as well as the CTO.

In late 2022 I joined Zimmer Biomet as a Senior Machine Learning Researcher.


## Aw Shucks, More?  
I wrote a short [Autobiogrphy]({% link autobiography.markdown %}) summarising my work experiences. 
It is mostly material targeted towards future me, but you are welcome to listen in.
