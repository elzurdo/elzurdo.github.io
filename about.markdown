Ex-Cosmologist turned Data Scientist with over 10 years experience in Machine/Deep Learning, statistical inference, and recently Reinforcement Learning. Result driven and highly detail oriented I’m motivated by intellectual challenges and love analysing data to communicate insights for better decisions within organisations. 

I am currently looking for a London-based permanent technical role where I’d be continuously posed with data-driven exciting and challenging questions.


A bit about my experience: 
Trained as a physicist, in my previous reincarnation I was a cosmologist, analysing maps of galaxies to measure aspects of Cosmology, e.g, the expansion rate of the Universe and the abundance of Dark Matter. 

In 2014 I transitioned to data science, where I first worked for 3.5 years in a small marketing consulting firm working mostly on customer/user segmentation. 

In 2018 I was employed as the first Data Scientist in a biotech company where I worked mostly on protein design for therapeutics by creating Machine/Deep Learning predictive models from the data produced in the lab.
