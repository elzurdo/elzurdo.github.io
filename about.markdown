## TL;DR  
I am an ex-Cosmologist turned Data Scientist with over 10 years experience in Machine/Deep Learning, statistical inference, and with some experience Optimisation by means of Reinforcement Learning. I am result driven and highly detail oriented, motivated by intellectual challenges and love analysing data to communicate insights for better decisions within organisations. 

[comment]: <>  I am looking for a London-based permanent technical role as an individual contributor in a data-driven company with exciting and challenging questions.


## In Detail   
Trained as a physicist, in my previous astronomy reincarnation I analysed maps of galaxies to measure aspects of Cosmology, e.g, the expansion rate of the Universe and the abundance of Dark Matter. 

In 2014 I transitioned to data science, where I first worked for 3.5 years in a small marketing consulting firm working mostly on customer/user segmentation. 

In 2018 I was employed as the first Data Scientist in a biotech company where I worked mostly on protein design for therapeutics by creating Machine/Deep Learning predictive models from the data produced in the lab.  

In 2020 I joined Babylon Health as a Senior Data Scientist.  

## Aw Shucks, More?  
I wrote a short [Autobiogrphy]({% link autobiography.markdown %}) summarising my work experiences. It is mostly material targeted towards future me, but you are welcome to listen in.
