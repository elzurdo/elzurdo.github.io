title:  "Frequentist vs. Bayesian: Two Statistical Philosophies"
---

In the previous century two main streams of stastical thought have been developed.  
They slightly differ in philosophy.  

The *Freuqnetist* approach puts a focus on *likelihoods*, which means quantifying the probability of the observed data for a given hypothesis. 

The *Bayesian* does the exact opposite by trying to quantify the *posterior*, i.e, the probability of a hypothesis for a given set of data.

Since the Frequetist is focused around a given hypothesis and the Bayesian is not, one insight is that the latter is a more flexible approach to examining and comparing multiple hypotheses. 

This topic is quite controversal amongst statisticians. I tried to summarise my two cents in this short summary

details TBD ...

## Mention

Frequentist is the Bayesian approach in the extreme case of a flat prior.
