title:  "Start Asking Your Data 'Why?' - A Gentle Introduction To Causal Inference - Part 1/4"
---

This is the first of a four part series aimed at decision makers, technical or managerial, who would like to improve their skills by adding causal intuition to their tool box. 

Here we describe the importance of causal thinking and what to expect from this series.

## Part 1of 4 - Why Ask *“Why?”*
**Causal techniques may result in more meaningful results than the common associative interpretation of data.**

Decision makers put a lot of trust in data. This confidence manifests in claims like “data does not lie”, “data is king”, “data is the new oil”, or best quipped by the statistician William E. Denim:

We are all beneficiaries of data driven decisions. 
We live healthier lives than our ancestors thanks to medical conclusions from biological research that suggest what we should and should not put into our bodies.

We also have access to all of human knowledge via pocket sized devices thanks to smart algorithms for effective communication of data. 
One common benefit is daily optimisation suggestions from applications. 
Navigation software, e.g, suggests the best routes from point A to B based on various assumptions made by the engineers on what is considered “optimal”.

However, when it comes to decision making, human or automated, a critical question is often overlooked  -  is data, in itself, really enough for making reasonable decisions on which to act? 

After all, a research lead might draw inconclusive or, even worse, incorrect conclusions from data. 
For example, even though we now know that smoking adds risk to developing lung cancer, 
in the 1950’s and 1960’s this was hotly debated, where many times data analyses were deemed inconclusive 
(see: [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5298160/), [2](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/16/6/1070.long)). 
Another example is the famous 2013 study on the benefits of the Mediterranean diet against 
heart disease that had to be retracted in 2018 by the most prestigious of medical journals, 
because not all participants were randomly recruited (see: [3](https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l341), [4](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-beware-scientific-studiesmost-wrong.html)).
