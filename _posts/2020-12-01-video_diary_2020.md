title:  "Video Diary 2020"
---

I have just completed my 2020 video diary, 
in which for every day I recorded two(ish) seconds, with only four missing entries!   

Below I detail this year's highlights some of which are captured within the video. 

Enjoy!

Days without videos: April 9th, August 22nd, October 14th, December 20th.  
These missed entries are filled by selected tweets from my lovely [@HaKabuk](https://twitter.com/HaKabuk){:target="_blank"}.

For this project I used my Pixel 2XL phone, and compiled with iMovie on my Mac.   


This is an ongoing project, eight years straight which I  
 have documented the experience in [a blog post](http://bit.ly/video-diary-wordpress){:target="_blank"}.  
Video diaries of recent years:      
2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013. 

## My 2020 Highlights

CoronaVirus plagued the world putting us in lockdown for most of the year. 
Michal and I, being on the conservative side, 
spent many weeks at a time in our cozy apartment.
As most people, we did not travel this year, unfortunately. 
In particular my streak of visiting Israel every year since leaving 
in 2004 came to an end.

Instead of travel we met our families via Zoom, 
normally on Sunday evenings for *KaZoom* sessions. 
On November 26th we also conducted one for Grandma’s 95th birthday. 

One highlight at home is that we converted our small secondary bedroom to an office 
and started purchasing things to keep us comfy and productive from tables to plants.
 
In the following I summarise my work and then life experiences of 2020.

## Work In 2020

### Job Changes
This year started off for me on a sour note, as on January 20th, after nearly two years, 
I was let go by LabGenius. My takeaway is that I can only be appreciative 
that I was given the opportunity to learn biology on the job, 
and in particular about drug discovery and protein engineering, which serves me well 
in understanding the amazing fine details of the development of the current pandemic. 
Another anecdote is that, for a while, I got to say that 

> I work in a biscuit factory and live in a rice mill 
(Both former, of course ...)

A sweet aspect of the layoff, however, was that I was given two months pay (in lieu),  
which was a great opportunity for me to upskill and look for new opportunities, 
while enjoying some *funemployment*.  E.g, learn neural networks more in depth 
and enabled me the freedom to explore other things like learn how to create this 
blog.  

Michal also searched for a new job and we both landed offers 
one day after each other on March 25th and 26th. 
One fun fact is that we are customers of both companies which motivated our applications.  
Realising how powerful the our health care app 
was at providing effective services, I was very glad to join Babylon Health.   

Another fun fact is that we timed it such that we started working on the same day, 
April 14th.  
I believe that both of us were in the first wave of people to 
both be interviewed and start working completely remote. 
During the year I visited the office, out of choice, three times.  

((Picture of us starting together))

(blog post worthy)

I proposed three talks for the annual PyData Global meetup, 
and they accepted one (August 26th), 
for which I prepared a tutorial that was hosted in the program on Nov 11th - 25th. 

A very nice aspect is that NumFocus, the organisers and and main sponsor of open source 
software, is [hosting the tutorial in the 
academia page](https://academy.numfocus.org/pydata/courses/introduction-multi-objective-optimisation/){:target="_blank"}, 
in edX format. I preempted to provide all links 
on my [github account](https://bit.ly/github-moo){:target="_blank"} 
(which was a good move considering they charge is 200£). 

This is the intro video (5 minutes)

I very much enjoyed the recording sessions (for which I did three to four takes!), 
resulting in 30 minutes of content plus an additional 60 of explaining the tutorial notebooks. 
Overall I'm happy that I got to share a topic that I feel is under appreciated in my 
field and get some exposure while I was at it (and a free ticket to the conference!). 
 
Open source, and Python in particular, has massive contributions to technology worldwide, 
so I am glad that I could have a made a small contribution. My friends Natan Mish and 
Pedro Tizai were of great help in commenting the drafts.

((blog worthy)  
For the past ten years I have been participating in the  
[Adopt-a-Physicist program](https://www.adoptaphysicist.org/){:target="_blank"}
that sets up correspondances between trained physicists and high school student. 
The students get to ask me 
about questions about life in physics or in general and I try my best to give them 
useful advise, or at least something anecdotal :-) .

This year one of the high school teachers was quite ambitious and had them write haikus 
about the physicists. Here are the ones written about me:

### Binge Watching 


#### TV Series 
We did not go to the movie theatres but we continued to binge a lot. 
 
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}
 
Here I mention noteworthy ones that I highly recommend (I try to 
sort here by order of recommendation). Some of these are new productions from 2020, 
but most of them are from previous that we were made aware of this year. 
At the very bottom of the post I list **all** the TV series that I can recall seeing.    

**Israeli productions**   
* [The Chef הטבח](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%98%D7%91%D7%97){:target="_blank"} ([imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13434148/){:target="_blank"})
* [Losing Alice לאבד את אליס](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%91%D7%93_%D7%90%D7%AA_%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A1){:target="_blank"} ([imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12398140/){:target="_blank"})
* [Maniac מנייאכ](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9B){:target="_blank"} ([imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12819234/){:target="_blank"})
* [Rehearsals חזרות](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA_(%D7%A1%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%AA_%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%D7%96%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%AA)){:target="_blank"} ([imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13464060/){:target="_blank"}) 
* [Polishuk פולישוק](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A7_(%D7%A1%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%AA_%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%D7%96%D7%99%D7%94)){:target="_blank"} ([imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2592038/){:target="_blank"}) This is the Israeli take of The Thick Of It and the American Veep

**Mostly USA and British productions**  
* Succession 
* West Wing (second viewing even better than first!)
* What We Do In The Shadows
* Queens Gambit
* Kidding
* The Last Dance
* Homecoming
* The Plot Against America
* Better Called Saul
* Genius

Also I loved keeping up to speed with current events Stephen Colbert through his anecdotal 
A Tonight Show, as well as Tooning Out The News. 

#### Movies 
We didn't see that many movies this year, as far as I recall we saw:  
* A Beautiful day in the neighborhood
* Bombshell
* 1917
* Parasites
* Watchmen (movie)
* Hunting the Wilderpeople
* Soul
* The Sound of Metal

### Binge Listening

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Girl_listening_to_radio.gif){:width="200"}

#### Music
Music-wise there wasn't anything new that really excited me this year.  
A artists that are worth mentioning as I learned to appreciate more: 
* Niki Minaj - A guilty pleasure of mine. She has great flow and very creative. E.g, see her going toe to toe with Stephen Colbert.
* Byoncé - I know that I'm late to the party, but I liked her stuff in the past, but started to really listen to her more carefully this year. Besides the obvious talent her lyrics are deep.
* Janelle Monáe - multi talented actor (Homecoming) and pop artist with a Prince like flare. 
* Eminem - my partner got me back to listening to him. Very talented and creative.



![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Spotify_logo_with_text.svg){:width="200"}

I recently realised that it is easy to transfer my playlist from iTunes to Spotify, 
something that I look forward to developing an sharing soon.  
For now I have shared my  
* [5 star songs](http://bit.ly/spotify-5stars){:target="_blank"} (my favourite)
* [4+ star songs](http://bit.ly/spotify-4plus){:target="_blank"} (4 and 5 star songs)


#### Podcasts 


I listened to a lot. So much so that I wrote a [podcast recommendations post]({% post_url 2020-06-28-podcasts %}){:target="_blank"}. 

### Recommended Life Books

I consider a few books as life changers. This year these are Why We Sleep, 
and 12 Rules For Life. I added these to my list of influential books that I feel 
best articulate human understanding and progress.

I have mentioned in the Work Book section The Book Of Why by Judea Pearl which also 
goes to this list. I started making a secondary list of influential books written 
by Israeli authors, that I consider intellectual heroes, which now include Judea Pearl, 
Yuval Noach Harari (Sapiens), Daniel Kalamahan (Thinking Fast And Slow) and Amos Tverski.  

  
A further list of influential Jews would be require much more thought 
(offhand Einstein, Feynman, Chomsky, ...) and all Homo Sapiens would be even more so 
(Jordan Peterson, Steven Pinker, ...).  


These sort of lists do exclude other great authors that I love their style 
(E.g, Michael Lewis, Paul Auster, Yonatan Gefen יהונתן גפן) for the simple reason that 
even though I love their writing styles and creative approaches to story telling, 
their writings do not encompass the intellctual depth that the other do.    


### Food

We are still (for the most part) vegetarian since late 2017, 
and I have done some intermediate fasting (600 calories per fasting day). 
Normally 6:1 (i.e, 1 day fasting per week), and possibly once 5:2 (2 days fasting per week) . 
Food-wise, Michal and I are still big on stir fry and shakshuka and very happy that there are a lot of plant based products emerging. 
Popcorn is always a fun snack, although we started stacking up on icecream, too. 
We also perfected the home meal experience of the veggie burger.


### Meditation 
I didn't do as much Vipassana sessoins as I would like, but I did practice it once 
and a while, normally between ten to, at most, and rarely 25-30 minutes.  

I did, though, meditate nearly daily on passages from The Daily Stoic by Holiday, Hanselman.  

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81UQvmjT3xL.jpg" width="150">
{: refdef} 

### Sports

I did some long distance running in the beginning of the year. 
That was replaced with bicycle riding. 
At first I used Michal’s small bike until I bought my own from a neighbor. 
I started cycling for hours, around our area to the Babylon office and back 
(11km each direction) and even to Richmond park and back. Michal made progress in her bike training. 
Besides that Covid-19 made us stop using the pool but did get us into the gym, especially on the Elliptical.

### Chess  

(blog post worthy, especially about the adrenaline)


I got addicted to chess, yet again, third time in my life. 
I managed to contain it, though.  
Since I am not a competitive type, and do not like to make rash decisions, 
as required in short time limited chess, I found that the best approach for me 
is to play games with daily moves.  

During the week or so of relapse I did notice a positive attribute - 
I frequently think about my work algorithms when I am away from the laptop 
(I try not on the weekends ...), and found that during this period I was seeing them 
even more clearly.   

I'm currently playing with online on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/){:target="_blank"} and [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/){:target="_blank"}.

### Technology
I’m still using the same MacBook Air that I purchased in 2013 
(I replaced the battery in August). 
Michal decided to buy us a Deebot (called ZurDeebot) that cleans our floor for us. 

My Pixel 2XL is still functioning, but tends to turn off when I connect to electricity 
(except for when the media is playing!...)


### Life Studies
Perhaps the only hobby, outside of work, that I developed this year is 
learning to play a little Bosa Nova on guitar.   

Michal was much more very creative: learned and grew a garden, 
learned to bake bread and make her own humus, as well as making beautiful physical diaries.
