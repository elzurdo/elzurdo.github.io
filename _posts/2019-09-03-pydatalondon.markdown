title: "Protein Design by Multi-Objective Optimisation"
---

As presented in PyData London Meetup #58 ([MAN](https://www.man.com/pydata-london-58th-meetup){:target="_blank"}, [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/events/264080884/){:target="_blank"})

Abstract:  

When optimising for multiple factors, a common practice is to reduce the problem to 1D, 
which, because of the limited search space, is likely to result in a suboptimal solution. 
In Multi-Objective Optimisation we consider a set of trade-off solutions, called the Pareto Front, 
as the optimal set, and by so explore a multi-dimensional space, where we are more likely 
to find improved solutions. 
Motivated by the challenge to empirically navigate the vast DNA combinatorial 
sequence space to discover therapeutic proteins, 
I discuss Pareto Front optimisation using Evolutionary Algorithms. 
In particular, I highlight [`DEAP`](https://github.com/DEAP/deap){:target="_blank"}, a Python platform for prototyping.
