title: "NASA Talk: Cosmology through the large-scale structure of the Universe"
---

This was a talk I was invited to deliver during my Ph.D at the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
More specifically at the Goddard Space Flight Center
Sciences and Exploration Directorate
Earth Sciences Division in New York City.

The talk was titled:  

***"Cosmology through the large-scale structure of the Universe"***

**Abstract**

The distribution of matter contains a lot of cosmological information. 
Applying N-point statistics one can measure the geometry and expansion 
of the cosmos as well as test General Relativity at scales of millions
to billions of light years.  In particular, I will discuss an exciting
recent measurement dubbed the *Baryonic Acoustic Feature*, which has
recently been detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy sample.
It is the largest known ``standard ruler" (half a billion light years
across), and is being used to investigate the nature of the acceleration
of the Universe.
