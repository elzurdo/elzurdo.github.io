title: "My Last Cosmology Talk"
---

This is the last talk that I gave as a working cosmologist in 
which I presented results from my post doc research.

The talk was titled:  

"Improved distance measurements with reconstructed WiggleZ"  

As presented at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics Oslo. 

One interesting fact is that there was a participant that had hearing problems, so my every word was translated to sign language by a translater and her assistent.
