title: "The Oddball in the Room - Attending a Theoretical Statistics Talk"
--- 
**There is no room of strangers that I'd rather be in than that full of curious minds.**

Today I found myself a bit over my head. Loving everything statistics I sat 
in a talk that turned out to be more on the heavy theoretical side, rather than the 
applied side, that I'm more comfortable with.

I did find the format of the discussion and my conversations with the all-academic participants very interesting.

The talk was hosted by the Royal Society of Statistics in Morgate area in London (fun fact: Reverand Bayes is buried right around the corner). Two authors Sebastian Engelke and Adrien Hitz presented their [new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01734), afterwhich participants in the crowd followed with their own presentations about the said paper. Thos participants, each in turn  congratulated the authors about their achievement, explained why it was inovative, timely, applicable as well as pointing out limitations and need for future research. A few of them even hailed it a ***New subject in statistics***. Very amicable indeed. About four or five people gave their constructive criticism, followed by eight more, who couldn't fly in or take the train, had their messages were read by one of the chair people. The last to speak were the authors, who gave a preliminary response to the said limitations and promissed to follow up with a more thoughtful repsonse to add to all the remarks that will be published in an upcoming journal of the RSS.

I later joked with the authors and the other professional statisticians that what attracted me most was my misreading of the abstract, in which they mentioned Pareto distributions (I type of decaying distribution like exponential just with a heavier tail) which I confused for Pareto optimisation, a method of optimisating a multiple parameters. I did have some personal take-aways. The core of the talk was how to use graphical models to quantify for exterme outliers, which is useful, e.g, for weather forcasting. 

Like I said, the technical details were a bit above my head, but I did enjoy speaking with the professional statisticians about their work, life in academia. Sharing "war" stories of my days as an academic doing cosmology research as well as a Data Scientist in the private sector. From the statistians I heard the familiar stories, e.g, the the two body problem (partners finding jobs in the same city), but also more interesting ones of how their work is used for government policy, e.g, fishing quota optimisation in Canadian waters.
