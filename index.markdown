Welcome to my blog! My name is Eyal.   

![image]({{ site.url }}/assets/bayes_tunbridge_wells.jpg){:width="200"} 

Here you can read about my love for anything about inference, 
e.g,  causality, information visualisation machine/deep learning 
and other mind blowing techniques like optimisation.  
 
Some blog posts are a bit more on the personal side, so consider this a conversation 
between myself and future 120 year old me where everyone is invited to listen!
