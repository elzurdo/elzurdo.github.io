As of August 2024 I've started crafting technical articles on
[my Medium page](https://eyal-kazin.medium.com/). The main themes so far are
Causality and Information Theory. I recommend start with these and see links within:

* ➡️ [Start Asking Your Data “Why?” — A Gentle Intro To Causality](https://bit.ly/start-ask-why-medium): *A beginner’s guide to thinking beyond correlations.*

* 🚅 [Information Theory for People in a Hurry](https://pub.towardsai.net/information-theory-in-a-hurry-a549a57f9bbb): *A quick guide to Entropy, Cross-Entropy and KL Divergence. Python code provided.* 🐍

* 🚪🚪🐐 [Lessons in Decision Making from the Monty Hall Problem](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/lessons-in-decision-making-from-the-monty-hall-problem-a6032f4b1032): *A journey into three intuitions: Common, Bayesian and Causal.*


Below are some more blog posts which are a mix of professional and  personal,
so consider this a conversation 
between myself and future 120 year old me where everyone is invited to listen!
