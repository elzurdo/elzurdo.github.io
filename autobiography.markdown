*I learned how to learn*   
**Claim for fame**: I never took a test twice.  אף פעם לא עשיתי מועד ב׳   
**Claim for fame II**: For a time I tutored enough not to use an ATM for months.  
**Claim for fame III**: Volunteered for reserve army training and released because I am "a good person".  

> We all get to physics by mistake   

[Professor Aharon Davidson](https://physics.bgu.ac.il/~davidson/){:target="_blank"} about my confession that I  initially intended on studying engineering before I fell in love with physics.  

 
* Tutored Mechanics and Electro Magnitism, Modern Physics  
* Briefly ran a "Quantum Camp" (קייטנת קוונטים)  
* In summer of 2002 I worked in construction  

The question with which I fell in love with physics as presented in Mechanics recitation by Irit Maor:  
> A helicopter is hovering above a mark X on the equator. The pilot drops a rock. Neglecting wind and friction, where in respect to the X will the rock land: North-East-South-West or something in between?  

I loved that we solved this just with words, and then learned the math tools to generate quantifiable predictions. By the time I got back to my dorm, I forgot the verbal explanation and had to build the logic up again from scratch. It was great!  

## Interim (Jul 2004 - Feb 2005)  
* Salvador Dali themed trip to Spain with Mom  
* While visiting Grandma in New Jersey, I fell in love with New York City for the second time  
* Applied to Universities in the USA.  
* Travelled the USA and went to many NBA games and concerts.

## Cosmology Research (2005-2014)

</p>

*I measured a bump on a graph which excited a small number of specialists.*    
**10 second elevator pitch**: As an observational cosmologist, I analysed 3D maps of galaxies to quantify the amount of dark matter in the Universe as well as measure its expansion rate.     
**Elevator pitch to the 100th floor**: To this end I measured the gravity generated large-scale structure of ensembles of distant galaxies. My focus was on a weak signal (1% effect!) which is considered the longest [*standard ruler*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ruler){:target="_blank"} known is cosmology at a length of half a billion light years!     
**Claim for fame**: In my [second publication](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...719.1032K/abstract){:target="_blank"} I pissed off a tenured professor by debunking [his claims](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.399.1663G/abstract){:target="_blank"}. 
**Claim for fame II**: I met eight nobel prize winners in physics, six of which attended my lectures.  


> I still can't believe that someone is paying me to study physics in New York City.  

Me a few months in NYU confessing to a professor about my amazement of living and studying in NY thanks to a [fellowship](https://www.macfound.org){:target="_blank"}.  

Favourite [Professor Andrei Gruzinov](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/andrei-gruzinov.html){:target="_blank"} quotes:  

> So, what should I go home and tell my wife?  

Andre's questions for most speakers (including Nobel Prize winners) of what the conclusion of their presentation was.  

> I'll sign your Ph.D paper thing, but my adivse to you is that you should learn more statistics.  

His conclusion after my dissertation cross-fire examination. He was right, and I did!.  

## Transitioning To Data Science (2014)  
*I participated in a garbage-in garbage-out project for [a](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08386775){:target="_blank"} [non-startup](https://web.archive.org/web/20170912075710/http://connectomex.com/){:target="_blank"}.*        
**Claim for fame**: I was known as "that guy with the blog post with the notebook". Strategically advertised in LinkedIn and Facebook forums, [the post](https://betterbayes.wordpress.com/2014/07/24/preperation-for-a-transition-to-data-science/){:target="_blank"} had over 1,000 reads in the first day (which was a lot at the time!)

> Go where the data are  

Prof. Michael Blanton suggesting how to choose between postdoc offers. I took his offer and did a postdoc in Australia, and then following the same advise left for a career in Data Science.  

## [SCL Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCL_Group){:target="_blank"} / [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica){:target="_blank"} (2014-2018)

</p>
*3.5 year highlight: A successful snail-mail A/B test project where I proved to myself that my Machine Learning model actually has some merit to it.*  
**What most people want to know**: Upon request I did not work on the 2016 presidential campain.   
**Claim for fame**: Half of a joke that I made about the [CEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nix){:target="_blank"} at a company party [made The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/cambridge-analytica.html){:target="_blank"}.   
**Claim for fame II**: I gave my one month notice before the massive press coverage.   

The half joke that made The New York Times:

![image]({{ site.url }}/assets/2017-03-06_NewYorkTimes2.png){:width="600"}


But for the intended auidence that was not the punch line. The punch line was (which needs context to appreciate): 
> How does he do it? He sells them Ripon!  

The context: Ripon was a customized campaign software platform that Cambridge Analytic sold. I always thought it a peculiar name (considering it sounds so much like Rip Off) until I learned that is is named after the town of [Ripon, Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripon){:target="_blank"}, where the Republican Party was founded).

## [LabGenius](https://www.labgeni.us/){:target="_blank"} (2018-2020)
*I made nice AI-ish visuals to impress investors.*    
**Claim for fame**: I made a presentation with cool animations that was circulated to all large pharmaceuticals worldwide.  
**Highlight**:  Got to learn protein biology on the job  


## [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/){:target="_blank"} (2020-)
I joined Babylon Health in mid April of 2020.
